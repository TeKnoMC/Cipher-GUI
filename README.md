# Cipher Helper
This project aims to provide an interface allowing for mathematical analysis of simple ciphertexts encrypted with historic "pen and paper" ciphers, such as substitutions, transpositions, and polyalphabetic ciphers.

Todo:
- Design basic layout:
    - Input/output boxes
    - Menu for description tools (bottom right quarter)
- Port python scripts for description tools to JavaScript and link to GUI
    - Could design plug-and-play like system for scripts - aid future development?
- Develop transformative modules
    - Substitution solver
    - Caesar solver (automated chi-squared analysis)
    - Viginere solver (automated IoC attack / chi-squared statistics)
    - Interactive transpositional work?
        - Turn output into draggable columns to help solve.
